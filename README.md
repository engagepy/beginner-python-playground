# Learn Python Basics with Practical Executable Code

### Each `name.py` file is an independent python script for you to try out, with no correlation to another.
#### Take each `name.py` as an independent project apt for beginners. Follow these simple steps to master them for real:
- Study the code in a particular `name.py`, start in any order. 
- Google the parts you do not understand initially, once comfortable start referring to the official documentation. 
- Rewrite the code on your local machine and try pushing it to your own fork of this repo
- Help improve the comments and examples in each `name.py` 
- Confident of your contribution -> Create a pull request

**Steps to Initiate:** *(Don't Over Think It. It's Easier Than you Think)*

You don't have to learn, if the idea is play!

1. Start by downloading python from : https://www.python.org/downloads/. It is safe, open source, popular and going places.

2. Now download this repo as a .zip by clicking on the green code button. Bottom most option should say "Download Zip".

3. Once in your downloads folder extract it to the desktop *(recommended for ease of locating in terminal)* or any location you prefer. 

4. Now head to the terminal or command, navigate to the directory python_learning you just extracted. *Don't know how to? Learn Terminal(Mac/Linux) here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgBd6rjuDQ Learn Command(Windows) here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBBWVgE0ewk*

5. By now you should be in the directory using command or terminal. Now type: `python filename.py`. Replace `file name` with any select file from this repo. Make sure it is precise in spelling and case, as is works best.

6. Each file when executed via method in step 5, relays the output on the terminal itself, so look out for that and play along. You'll find useful tax and partner share calculators, few nostalgic games and other fun experiments. Each line I've understood, written and enjoyed, in that order. 

7. Some files may require access tokens and other parameters that are API/system specific. So look out for those and feel free to ask for help @ `mailzora@pm.me`

> Most importantly, if you undertook even a few of these steps then you have the calling to code. Nothing beats diving right in, it is how we learn. 

> Since this is my first repo, I hope to keep a connect with it, am also leaving my future goals below which hopefully I've achieved by the time you're reading these. If they're all checked means I've continued learning and you can too. 

> I'll update and mark them as I progress. That way if you get past learning and understanding all the code in this repository, you have a roadmap to follow further. What truly set me on this path were lesson on `Codecademy` -> https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/python
