# python_learning

**Intro:**

> A collection of code written in my learning phase. Mostly python, for it had me at first sight. My journey is not usual, I spent 20s setting up and operating businesses, teaching scuba and making bread in the non code world. 
This code path started around >30< with an objective to build real solutions, add to the open source community, and to hopefully contribute lines of code to something meaningful.  

This Repo contains .py files. Each representing an independent code project apt for beginners. 

One doesn't have to learn code to use code. Here are some steps if you wish to dip your feet ..

1. You can indulge and test the water by simply downloading python from : https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Download this repo as a .zip by clicking on the greeen code button. Bottom most option should say "Download Zip"

3. Once in your downloads folder extract it to the desktop *(recommended for ease of locating in terminal)* or any location you prefer. 

4. Now head to the terminal or command, navigate to the directory python_learning you just extracted. *Don't know how to? Learn Terminal(Mac/Linux) here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgBd6rjuDQ Learn Command(Windows) here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBBWVgE0ewk*

5. Once in the directory, type: python <filename>.py   || Exclude <> during actual typing, applicable for all code instances in this file ||

6. Each file on running puts the output on the terminal, so look out for that and play along. Some are calculators, some games and some just for fun experiments. 

7. Some files may require access tokens and other parameters that are API/system specific. So look out for those and feel free to ask for help @ https://www.zorawarpurohit.com

> Most importantly, if you undertake even a few of these steps then you have the calling to code. It is a bug to eliminate bugs, no way to learn bests; diving right in!

Since this is my first repo, I hope to keep a connect with it. So I am leaving my future goals below.
I'll update and mark them as I progress. That way if you get past learning and understanding all the code in this repository, you have a roadmap to follow further. What truly set me on this path of learning is nudges from my cousin Sid and Codecademy.
If you find the bug in you: https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/python , I'll keep Sid out of this. For now ;)
